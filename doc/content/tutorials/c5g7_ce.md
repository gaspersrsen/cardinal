This model consists of a single UO$_2$ assembly from the 3D C5G7 extension case in [!cite](c5g7), where control
rods are fully inserted in the assembly to induce strong axial and radial gradients. Instead of using the multi-group
cross sections from the C5G7 benchmark specifications, the material properties in [!cite](c5g7_materials) are used.
At a high level the geometry consists of the following lattice elements (in a 17x17 grid):

- 264 fuel pins composed of UO$_2$ pellets clad in zirconium with a helium gap;
- 24 control rods composed of B$_4$C pellets clad in aluminum (with no gap) which occupy the assembly guide tubes;
- A single fission chamber in the central guide tube composed of borated water with a trace amount of U-235 clad in aluminum (with no gap).

The remainder of the assembly which is not filled with these pincells is composed of borated water. Above the top of the fuel there is a
reflector region which is penetrated by the inserted control rods. The relevant dimensions can be found in [table1].
