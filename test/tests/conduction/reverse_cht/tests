    requirement = "The system shall allow MOOSE and NekRS to be coupled via conjugate heat transfer, where MOOSE sends NekRS a wall temperature and NekRS sends MOOSE a wall heat flux. This is tested by building a two-region slab, where the left half is solved by MOOSE and the right-half is solved by NekRS. The analytic solution for temperature is compared against the coupled CHT solution."
