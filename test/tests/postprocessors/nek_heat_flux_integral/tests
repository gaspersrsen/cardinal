                  "on the nekRS mesh. The gold file was created "
                  "by running the moose.i input, which computes the same integrals using "
                  "existing MOOSE postprocessors on the same mesh on auxvariables that match "
                  "the functional form of the solution fields initialized in the pyramid.udf. "
                  "Perfect agreement is not to be expected, since the underlying basis functions "
                  "and quadrature rules are different between nekRS and MOOSE's linear Lagrange "
                  "variables - we just require that they are reasonably close. A fairly fine mesh "
                  "is used in MOOSE to get closer to the higher-polynomial-order integration in nekRS."
